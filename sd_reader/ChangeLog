	* support for SDHC cards (disabled by default)
	* support for FAT32 (disabled by default)

2008-06-08 sd-reader
	* new "init" command to allow reinitialization of memory card
	* fix searching through multi-cluster directories
	* fix reading directory entries spanning a cluster border (backport from mega-eth)
	* do not abort the whole lfn entry when the file name is too long, just drop single characters (backport from mega-eth)
	* change fat16_get_dir_entry_of_path() to ignore a slash at the end (backport from mega-eth)
	* make listing a directory's content much faster (backport from mega-eth)
	* shrink code size by centralizing cluster offset calculation (backport from mega-eth)
	* some other small fixes and optimizations

2007-12-13 sd-reader
	* dual-license the major implementation modules under GPL and LGPL

2007-06-03 sd-reader
	* Fix reading beyond cached block (by Benjamin Meier).
	* Implement support for reading and writing file modification dates/times.
	  (Thanks to Torsten Seeboth for testing.)

2007-03-01 sd-reader
	* Avoid LFN directory entries for the "." and ".." directory references.
	  This prevented Windows from deleting directories.
	* Handle special case where the 8.3 filename begins with 0xe5.
	* Fix return value of fat16_delete_file() when deleting empty files.
	* Fix fat16_clear_cluster() which was zeroing only 16 of every 32 bytes.

2007-01-20 sd-reader
	* fix directory creation
	  - correctly create "." and ".." directory entries (8.3 <-> lfn versions)
	  - correctly clear cluster containing the directory entries for new directory

2006-11-01 sd-reader
	* Implement creation and deletion of directories.
	* Clear the directory entries of new directory clusters.
	* Prevent linkage against printf().
	* Make the use of malloc()/free() optional.

2006-09-01 sd-reader
	* Fix shortening files.
	* Fix free disk space calculation.

2006-08-24 sd-reader
	* Improve sleep handling.
	* Display extended card information on boot and
	  when executing the "disk" shell command.
	* Correctly determine FAT type by cluster count.
	* Fix cluster allocation beyond card capacity.

2006-08-16 sd-reader
	* Provide FAT16 capacity and usage information.
	* Implement the backspace key in the mini shell.
	* Enter idle mode when waiting for uart activity.
	* Make the Card Select pin MCU dependent as well.
	* Add mini shell commands to documentation.

2006-08-08 sd-reader
	* Thanks go to Torsten Seeboth for his ongoing efforts
	  to test changes, fix regressions and give suggestions.
	  Many of the changes below were initiated by him.
	* Much more reliable card initialization.
	* Highly improved performance
	  - optional write buffering
	  - better cluster handling
	  - remove unneeded SPI access when reading from buffered block
	  - use highest spi frequency after card initialization
	* Add superfloppy support.
	* Better checks when opening a FAT16 filesystem.
	* Provide SPI pin mappings for commonly used ATmegas.
	* Fix resizing files, hangs could occur.
	* Fix overflow when creating files with names longer than 31 characters.
	* Fix numerous other small things.

2006-03-19 sd-reader
	* Fix speed regressions.

2006-03-16 sd-reader
	* Initial release.
